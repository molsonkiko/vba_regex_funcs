VBA regex functions
============

*VBA adapations of Python re functions*

Features
--------

* Regular expression functions adapted from python's re library
* Several functions that can be used from a worksheet once the add-in is enabled.

How to use
----------

* The functions can be used in VBA macros if you want, but if you want to use them as worksheet functions, do the following:
	1. Open Excel.
	2. Go to Options -> Add-ins -> Go -> Browse
	3. Select the path to RegexFunctions.xlam in your file explorer
	4. Open up regexfunctions_addin_test.xlsx and use F9 to refresh all the functions. You can visually inspect the results and source code to make sure it looks like successful_test_outcomes.png.
* See the CHANGELOG for what functions you can use.
